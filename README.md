# Librarian Training App
This application allows the user to choose between three tasks on startup: Replacing Books, Identifying Areas, and Finding Call Numbers.  This application was built using C# Windows Forms App .NET Framework 4.8 in Visual Studio 2022. 

## Getting Started

### Startup Menu
Users can choose which task they want to do.

### Replacing Books
To effectively place books on library shelves, librarians must skillfully organize call numbers both numerically and alphabetically. The application will generate 10 random call numbers. Rearrange the call numbers in ascending order in the sorted section. Check if your ordering matches the correct sequence.

Users can verify if they have correctly arranged the sequence, review the correct order, and restart the task if needed.

### Identifying Areas
The Dewey Decimal System's top-level categories are crucial for locating books in a library. This task will help users practice matching call numbers with their respective descriptions. Match call numbers (top-level only) with their corresponding descriptions. You will see four randomly selected items in the first column. The second column will present seven possible answers, including the correct match and three incorrect ones. Check if the columns are matched correct.

### Finding Call Numbers
Understanding the Dewey Decimal System's hierarchy is crucial for effective navigation. This quiz delves into the system, beginning with third-level entries like "752 Color." Users see only the description, not the call number, and are presented with four top-level options. One option is correct, and three are randomly selected incorrect answers. Upon selection, four options from the next level are revealed, progressing until the most detailed level is reached.

If users make an incorrect choice, they will receive a notification, and the correct answer for that level will be revealed. Following this, four options from the next level will be presented to guide users through the progression of the quiz.
